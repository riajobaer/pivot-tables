# Pivot Tables
Pivot tables are used to summarize, sort, organize, group, count, total or average data stored in a database. 
My data set consists of 894 records and 8 fields. Salesperson, Product, Region, Customer, Date, Item Cost, No.Items, Total Cost.
Here I use pivot table to group date, reorganize and summarize selected columns and rows of data in a spreadsheet or database table to obtain a desired report.


I also create a pivot chart from a table for visualizations my data.
Here's some screenshot with demo application
